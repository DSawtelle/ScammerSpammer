# ScammerSpammer
Simple scam sites are often predicated on the use of a form request that passed the entered data to a specific address. That address and the request can be generated and spammed with dummy data to flood the scammer with very difficult data to decipher from real data.

### How It Works
The script will continuously generate data with randomized elements to flood a scammer with dummy data. A set of JSON files are used to allow easy randomization of locations, names, and other components for that data.
The goal is to generate data such that anyone who falls for the scam's data is lost in a sea of similar bad data.
